# Reinforcement Learning for Snake Game

## Key Ideas

### 1. Environment Setup
- Game board representation
- Snake representation
- Food placement

### 2. State Space
- Current position of the snake's head
- Position of the food
- Current direction of the snake
- Position of obstacles (walls, snake body)

### 3. Action Space
- Four possible actions: up, down, left, right

### 4. Reward System
- Positive reward for eating food
- Negative reward for collisions (walls, self)
- Small negative reward for each step (to encourage efficiency)

### 5. Q-Learning Algorithm
- Q-table initialization
- Exploration vs. exploitation (epsilon-greedy strategy)
- Q-value update formula

### 6. Training Process
- Episode structure
- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon)
- Periodic evaluation of performance

### 7. Neural Network Approach (Deep Q-Learning)
- Network architecture
- Experience replay
- Target network for stability

### 8. Performance Metrics
- Average score over time
- Length of snake achieved
- Learning curve visualization

### 9. Challenges and Optimizations
- Dealing with sparse rewards
- Curriculum learning (gradually increasing difficulty)
- Transfer learning from simpler to more complex environments

### 10. Comparison with Other Algorithms
- Policy Gradient methods
- Actor-Critic algorithms
